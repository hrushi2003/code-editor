# 🚀 Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor

A Google Docs–style collaborative code editor built with **React + Monaco Editor**, **WebSockets**, and **MongoDB**.  
Supports real-time cursor tracking, batched updates, and efficient compaction of operational logs.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖊️ **Live Code Editing** – Multiple users can edit the same file simultaneously.
- 👥 **Remote Cursor Tracking** – See collaborators' cursors and names in real-time.
- ⚡ **Low-Latency Updates** –  
  - Cursor positions are emitted instantly.  
  - Text updates are sent per keystroke for responsiveness.  
  - Backend updates are **batched** for efficiency.  
- 📦 **Operational Log Storage (CRDT-inspired)** – Every edit is stored as a payload with position and timestamp.
- 🧹 **Automatic Compaction** –  
  - Old operations are periodically merged into snapshots.  
  - Keeps database size manageable and lookup efficient.
- 🔄 **Diff/Patch Algorithm** – Efficiently applies incoming changes with near O(1) updates.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Monaco Editor, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, WebSocket  
- **Database:** MongoDB (Ops log + snapshots)

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **Payload Generation**  
   - Each edit generates a payload:  
     ```json
     {
       "startIndx": 0,
       "endIndx": 0,
       "newLines": ["e"],
       "startColumn": 0,
       "endColumn": 0,
       "deleteCount": 1,
       "timeStamp": 1694567890000
     }
     ```

2. **Frontend → Backend**  
   - Cursor updates: sent instantly.  
   - Text updates: emitted live but **batched before DB writes**.

3. **Backend Storage**  
   - Stores operations like a CRDT log.  
   - Runs **compaction every 10 minutes** or when a file is opened.
   - Operations update in DB takes O(1) in general.

4. **Diff/Patch Algorithm**  
   - Applies ops in timestamp order.  
   - Achieves **O(1)** for most updates, **O(n)** worst case during compaction.

---

## 📊 Efficiency

- **Cursor emission latency:** ~30–80 ms  
- **Text update latency:** ~100–200 ms  
- **DB writes:** Batching reduces ops from 1000s → 10s  
- **Compaction complexity:** amortized ~O(1)–O(n), runs in background

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- 🔐 Access control (roles: leader, member).  
- 📝 Syntax highlighting with Monaco’s language services.  
- 🌍 Support for cross-region low-latency replication.
